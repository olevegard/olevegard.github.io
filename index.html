        <p>Hello and welcome to this weird place where I am writing to none other than myself!</p>

<p>First of all, I'd like to say that the name is not final, I just haven't figured out a clever name for it yet. Maybe I never will. </p>

<p>As you probably have guessed by now, this game draws a lot of inspiration from DX Ball. The reason I choose to do a DX Ball remake is that it's quite easy to make. I have tried making more complex games earlier, and failed. So I think DX Ball is a fitting one-person challenge. </p>

<a name="technology" class="anchor" href="#technology"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Technology</h1>

<p>As for technology, this game will be written almost entirely in C++11¹. The code is to remain platform-independent². </p>

<p>When it comes to third party libraries, only <code>SDL2.0</code> will be used. With the possible addition of <code>OpenGL</code> later on. But since <code>SDL2.0</code> already uses <code>OpenGL</code>, it might not be necessary.</p>

<h1>
<a name="coding-standards" class="anchor" href="#coding-standards"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Coding standards</h1>

<p>The coding standards at this project is yet to be properly defined. However, there are a few rules.</p>

<h2>
<a name="stylistic" class="anchor" href="#stylistic"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Stylistic</h2>

<ul>
<li>Always put angle brackets ( <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> )</li>
<li>Function names starts with uppercase letters and uses camel case. Underscore is permitted in some cases.</li>
<li>Variable names start with a lowercase letter, and uses camel case. Underscore is permitted in some cases.</li>
<li>(System³) Hungarian notation is not permitted.</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="general" class="anchor" href="#general"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>General</h2>

<ul>
<li>The code is to be compiled with <code>./buildDXB.h</code>. ANY warnings that occurs are to be fixed properly. </li>
<li>As far as possible, prevent the use of this to assign variables etc. </li>
<li>People are permitted to kick anyone who uses a macro</li>
<li>Cost are to be applied to variables passed by reference and functions whenever possible. </li>
<li>Functions are not to be longer than one screen length unless you have a really good reason.</li>
<li>Use proper names for variables and functions. Long names is not an issue, unless it's approaching 80 chars</li>
<li>DON'T REPEAT YOURSELF.</li>
<li>Keep things simple, don't rely on clever/ heavily optimized functions. </li>
<li>Rather than writing own code, functionality in the <code>standard C++ library</code> should be used.</li>
</ul><p>Following the above rules, there will be more code to write. But your code will require less comments and will be easier to understand and debug. ( Anyone who claims they don't produce bugs are liars. )</p>

<p>¹ If the game is ever ported to work on <code>iPhone/iPad</code>, the code might have to be ported to Objective <code>C++(11)</code> <br>
² As of now, the code only works on <code>Linux</code>, this is due to lack of timing functions. But it'll be easy to port the <code>Timer</code> class to <code>Windows</code><br>
